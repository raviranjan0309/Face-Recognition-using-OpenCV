The whole process for face recognition using OpenCV can be divided in three major steps:
a.	The first step to detect faces in the database images with multiple images for everyone using haarcascade classifier.
b.	The next step is to build model using Local Binary Patterns Histograms Face Recognizer. 
c.	The last step is to test the face recognizer to recognize faces it was trained for.

Technical Specification:
•	Python 3.5
•	Packages – numpy, cv2, os, Image
•	Dataset: Yale Face Database
